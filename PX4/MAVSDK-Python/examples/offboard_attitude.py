"""
Some caveats when attempting to run the examples in non-gps environments:

- `drone.action.arm()` will return a `COMMAND_DENIED` result because the action requires switching
  to LOITER mode first, something that is currently not supported in a non-gps environment. You will
  need to temporarily disable this part here:
  `https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/blob/develop/plugins/action/action_impl.cpp#L61-L65`

- `drone.offboard.stop()` will also return a `COMMAND_DENIED` result because it requires a mode
  switch to HOLD, something that is currently not supported in a non-gps environment.
